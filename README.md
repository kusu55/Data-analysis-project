# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
Introduction
Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis Project repository! This project provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data using Python. The main objectives are to import and understand the dataset, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, analyze the data to extract meaningful insights, and visualize the results to make the findings more comprehensible.
